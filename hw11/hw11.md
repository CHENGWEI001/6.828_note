* When we do ```echo hello > a.txt``` in current working dir ```work```, what would happen?
  * inode for ```work``` would update its inode , size would be increased by 1 dirent , and add one dirent for information about the a.txt inode ( ex : name: a.txt, inode is new allocated inode for a.txt)
  * and since a.txt is new allocated inode, it also need to update its inode information to inode blocks along with its content block.
  * Follow the change the lab mentioned, it hit invalid inode because a.txt inode information is not updated in inode blocks, so when next time bootup , when we try to access work/a.txt, from work inode dirents find assuming a.txt inum, then try to access a.txt inode, but since a.txt inode is not updated ( in code it modified to blk#0) , so we hit invalid inode type error.
  * For homework assignment , it is asking to optimize not to read blk from log blk which is already blk cache, it make sence, since in log_write, the block ( in cache) is marked dirty , it is gurantee wont' be evicted, so that if there is case where following operation want to read back the data, from block cache it can read the latest data from the block cache until it flush to disk.
